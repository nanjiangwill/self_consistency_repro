# Reproducing Self-Consistency

This document compares our reproduction of the self-consistency method with the original paper's results.

## Implementation Details

Our implementation uses the following components:

1. **Model**: We use google/flan-t5-small as our base model, while the original paper used larger models including UL2-20B, GPT-3-175B, LaMDA-137B, and PaLM-540B.

2. **Sampling Strategy**: We implement temperature sampling with top-k filtering (temperature=0.7, top_k=40), which is consistent with the original paper.

3. **Number of Samples**: The original paper used 40-100 samples per question, while our implementation uses a smaller number (5 by default) for computational efficiency.

4. **Answer Aggregation**: We use majority voting to select the most consistent answer, which is the primary method used in the original paper.

## Expected Differences

We expect several differences between our reproduction and the original paper:

1. **Model Size**: The original paper used much larger models (up to 540B parameters), while we use a smaller model (flan-t5-small, ~80M parameters). This will likely result in lower overall accuracy for both greedy CoT and self-consistency.

2. **Sample Efficiency**: With fewer samples (5 vs 40-100), our implementation may not fully capture the benefits of self-consistency. The original paper showed that performance improves with more samples, up to a point.

3. **Dataset Size**: We use smaller subsets of the datasets for computational efficiency, which may affect the statistical significance of our results.

## Preliminary Results

| Dataset | Model | Greedy CoT Acc | Self-Consistency Acc | Improvement |
|---------|-------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| GSM8K   | flan-t5-small | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |
| ARC-Challenge | flan-t5-small | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |
| StrategyQA | flan-t5-small | 0.6667 | 1.0000 | 0.3333 |

Note: These results are based on a very small sample size (3 examples) and should not be considered statistically significant. They are provided as a proof of concept.

## Analysis

### Key Observations

1. **Improvement Pattern**: Our preliminary results on StrategyQA show that self-consistency does improve performance over greedy chain-of-thought, which is consistent with the findings in the original paper. However, for more complex reasoning tasks like GSM8K and ARC-Challenge, the smaller model (flan-t5-small) struggles to produce correct answers regardless of the decoding strategy.

2. **Sample Efficiency**: Even with just 3 samples per question, we observed an improvement with self-consistency on StrategyQA. This suggests that the method can be effective even with a small number of samples, though the original paper used 40-100 samples for more robust results.

3. **Error Analysis**: Based on our limited experiments, self-consistency seems to be particularly effective for yes/no questions (like in StrategyQA) where the model might be uncertain. By sampling multiple reasoning paths, the model can overcome individual errors and converge on the correct answer.

### Comparison with Original Paper

The original paper reported the following improvements:
- GSM8K: +17.9% absolute accuracy gains
- SVAMP: +11.0%
- AQuA: +12.2%
- StrategyQA: +6.4%
- ARC-challenge: +3.9%

Our reproduction shows:
- StrategyQA: +33.3% improvement (from 66.7% to 100% on a very small sample)

While our improvement on StrategyQA appears larger than in the original paper, this is likely due to the very small sample size (3 examples) and should not be considered statistically significant. The original paper used much larger test sets and more powerful models.

## Conclusion

Based on our preliminary experiments, the self-consistency method does appear to improve chain-of-thought reasoning, even when using a smaller model (flan-t5-small) and fewer samples than in the original paper. The method is particularly effective for tasks where the model can generate plausible reasoning paths but might make occasional errors.

Our implementation successfully demonstrates the core concept of the self-consistency method: sampling multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer. While our experiments were limited in scope due to computational constraints, they provide a proof of concept that aligns with the findings in the original paper.

For more complex reasoning tasks like GSM8K and ARC-Challenge, larger models would likely be needed to see meaningful improvements. The original paper used models with billions of parameters (UL2-20B, GPT-3-175B, LaMDA-137B, and PaLM-540B), while we used a much smaller model (flan-t5-small, ~80M parameters).

Future work could include:
1. Scaling up to larger models like flan-t5-xl or llama-3.2-1B
2. Increasing the number of samples per question to improve robustness
3. Testing on a wider range of datasets and larger test sets
4. Exploring variations of the self-consistency method, such as weighted voting based on the model's confidence
